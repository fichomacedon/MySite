        <h2>SEE WHAT WE STAND FOR</h2>
        <p>
          As the largest United States military branch, we defend our nation’s
          freedom and safety as well as provide stability during challenging
          times. <br />
          This has been a focus since 1775 when the Army’s fight for
          independence began. <br />
          Today, we honor a legacy rooted in freedom and lead by example with
          core values that every Soldier lives by.
